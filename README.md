# Video Frame Rate Upscaling Using Neural Networks

## Task

Survey common and state of the art algorithms for video frame interpolation. Implement at least two of the surveyed algorithms based on generative models and compare their performance to different approaches used in the video frame interpolation domain (e.g. convolution neural networks) on publicly accessible image datasets.
